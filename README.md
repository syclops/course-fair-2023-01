# Course Fair for Fall 2023

Here are two courses that I'm planning to offer for Fall 2023.

Each course:

- Is worth **2 credits**.
- Will meet **once a week for the whole semester**.
- Has **SoftDes as a prerequisite**.
- Counts for **computing elective credit**.

The courses can be taken together; the rough plan is that the courses would be
offered in a single block. For example, one course may be offered Tuesdays from
1-2:40 and the other on Fridays from 1-2:40.

## Software Development Tools

This course will teach you fundamentals of tools used for software development.
You can think of it as Olin's take on the [Missing Semester of your CS
Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) course, but with more of a focus on
software engineering skills. There will be weekly readings/videos drawn from a
variety of sources, a lecture with some exercises to help you practice the
content, and a problem set.

You are expected to have taken SoftDes. This means having a machine running
Linux (dual boot, WSL, VM, etc.) and some familiarity with the command line and
Python programming.

### Schedule

This schedule is tentative, but mostly set.

1. Introduction and Command-Line Basics
2. Scripting in Bash and Python
3. Command-Line Environment and API Access
4. System Configuration
5. Logging in Scripts and Systems
6. Profiling and Performance Analysis
7. Debugging Tools and Techniques
8. Advanced Version Control in Git
9. Continuous Integration and GitHub Actions
10. Virtualization, Containers, and Docker
11. Configuration Management Tools and Ansible
12. Cloud Infrastructure and Amazon AWS
13. Infrastructure Management Tools and Terraform

### Assessment

This course will be graded by your performance on problem sets.

## Applied Software Engineering

This course will teach you basics of developing software in the context of a
larger project. You will learn a few skills useful for running a software
project, including how to review code, write good tests, and manage software
teams. You will practice these skills by applying them to your existing software
projects, which can be from SCOPE, project teams, research groups, etc.

On some weeks, there will be a pre-reading or video to watch, and we will
spend the class meeting discussing some of these concepts. On other weeks, we
may try applying these concepts to your projects, by workshopping an existing
project together.

You are expected to have taken SoftDes. This means having a machine running
Linux (dual boot, WSL, VM, etc.) and some familiarity with the command line and
Python programming.

### Schedule

The following topics will be spread out through the semester, with additional
topics, project check-ins, or work time as needed.

- Introduction and Tooling
- Software Requirements
- Teaming
- Code Reviews
- Documentation
- Testing
- Dependencies and Versioning

### Assessment

Each week, you will be expected to submit a journal reflection either about the
concepts that week or on the progress of your project. You will also be asked to
define deliverables for your software project early in the semester, including
evidence that you have applied the concepts in class to your project. You will
be graded on a combination of your journal entries and your software project.
